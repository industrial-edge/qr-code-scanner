## Description

### Overview

This application examples shows how to connect a QR Code Scanner via USB to the Industrial Edge Device. The scanned QR Code will be sent to a PLC and displayed in an HMI Panel.

### General task

The application reads the QR Code provided by the scanner and publishes it on the Databus to the topic corresponding to the OPC UA Connector, which sends the data to the PLC. This topic needs to be created in the Databus in advance.
Scanner type, plc tag, databus topic as well as databus credentials can be configured via an external configuration file.

## Requirements

### Used components

- Industrial Edge App Publisher V1.10.5
- Docker Engine 18.09.6
- Docker Compose V2.4
- OPC UA Connector V1.8.1
- Common Connector Configurator V1.8.1-4
- Databus V2.1.0-4
- Databus Configurator V2.0.0-5
- Industrial Edge Device V1.10.0-9
- QR Code Scanner: SIMATIC MV320
- TIA Portal V16
- PLC: CPU 1518 FW 2.8.3

### TIA Project

The used TIA Portal project can be found in the [miscellaneous repository](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous) in the tank application folder and is also used for several further application examples:

- [Tia Tank Application](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous/tree/main/tank%20application)
  
### Configuring PLC Connection

Further information about how to configure the OPC UA Connection to write data to the PLC can be found in the [docs](docs/PLC_connection.md) section

- Configure Databus
- Configure OPC UA Connection

## Installation

You can find the further information about the following steps in the [docs](./docs/Installation.md)

- [Configure QR Code Scanner](docs/Installation.md#configure-qr-code-scanner)
- [Build application](docs/Installation.md#build-application)
- [Upload app to Industrial Edge Management](docs/Installation.md#upload-scanner-app-to-the-industrial-edge-managment)
- [Deploying application to Industrial Edge Device](docs/Installation.md#deploying-of-qr-code-scanner-demo)

## Usage

Plug your SIMATIC MV320 Bar Code Scanner (or any other USB Scanner) to one of the USB Ports of your Industrial Edge Device.

Go to the TIA Portal Project, start the HMI Runtime and scan any available QR Code (e.g the following QR Code). A pop up will appear with the content of the scanned code.

You can also open the GBD data block in the TIA Portal and check the content of the APP_QRCode variable in the app signals structure.
